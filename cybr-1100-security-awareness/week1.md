 
# Week 1 – Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**  
What was covered this week? Summarize key ideas in 2–3 sentences.  
 We covered Module 1 for Netacad and created our own github pages and portfolios. We figured out blackboard and netacad and how to access our classwork. 
**Artifacts:**  
- Screenshot of MFA setup  
- Screenshot of GitHub Pages live site  
 
**Reflection:**  
Write 1–2 paragraphs about what you learned and why it matters. Connect it to everyday security habits or the workplace.  
 I learned about how much I know about computer security from our netacad knowlege check. It matters because I'll know how much I need to improve on and learn more about in class. Learning more about security and being more aware about it can help me protect my personal devices and data.
**AI Use Note:**  
If you used an AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), briefly describe how you used it (e.g., brainstorming, proofreading).
I did not use AI.
