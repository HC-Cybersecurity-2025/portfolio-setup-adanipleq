 
# Week 1 â€“ Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**   
 We covered Module 1 for Netacad and created our own github pages and portfolios. We figured out how to use the AI bot SAGE and we learned about the CIA triad, difficulties in preventing attacks, why cybersecurity is important, how to identify threat actors, and comphrehensive cybersecurity stratetgy.   
**Artifacts:**  
- Screenshot of MFA setup  
- Screenshot of GitHub Pages live site  
 
**Reflection:**    
 I learned about how much I know about computer security from our netacad knowlege check. It matters because I'll know how much I need to improve on and learn more about in class. In module one of our security awareness, I learned more about security and being more aware about it can help me protect my personal devices and data.

**AI Use Note:**  
I did not use AI.

**CASE PROJECT 1-3 Sources of Security information**
Listed below is my table containing advantages, disadvantages, examples, and rating sources of security information.
|Sources | Security Content  | Consumer Content  | Vendor Content  | Security Experts  | Direct Instruction  | Family & Friends  | Personal  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Example | Unbiased Online/Printed Articles. For Example:  | Consumer-Based Magazines/Broadcasts Not Devoted To Security But Provide End-User Tips. For Example:  | Material from security vendors who sell security services, hardware, or software. For Example:  | IT staff recommendations or newsletters. For Example:  | college classes or a workshop conducted by a local computer vendor. For Example: CYBR-1100  | A Family Member/Friend thaty could reccomend security tips.  | Your own personal opinion/experience.  |
| Advantages | Unbiased, Solely Providing Security-Based Articles.  | Provide Security Tips To Consumers.  | Teach you security awareness based on products you purchase from them.  | Experts in their fields, can provide expert advice.  | Give you one on one feedback and consultation while you learn.  | You can always reach out to a friend or family about security issues.  | You can make decisions based on personal experiences and opinions. |
| Disatvanatges  | Can overlook ethical dimensions of security threats.  | Due to being consumer-based, they are not entirely security focused.  | They can only give you information on hardware they sell.  | You cannot have one on one conversation and troubleshooting with them.  | Your course may not give you all of the information needed on specific security nneds. | They could give you unsafe tips.  | You may not know everything!  |
