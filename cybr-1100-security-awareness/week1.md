 
# Week 1 – Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**   
 We covered Module 1 for Netacad and created our own github pages and portfolios. We figured out how to use the AI bot SAGE and wWe learned about the CIA triad, difficulties in preventing attacks, why cybersecurity is important, how to identify threat actors, and comphrehensive cybersecurity stratetgy.   
**Artifacts:**  
- Screenshot of MFA setup  
- Screenshot of GitHub Pages live site  
 
**Reflection:**    
 I learned about how much I know about computer security from our netacad knowlege check. It matters because I'll know how much I need to improve on and learn more about in class. In module one of our security awareness, I learned more about security and being more aware about it can help me protect my personal devices and data.

**AI Use Note:**  
I did not use AI.

**Have I been pwned?** Yes, Hot Topic had a data breach in October of 2024 and my account was included in it! My Thankfully, it doesn’t mention my password, but I changed it just in case.

**What are your feelings now that you know about your compromised data? Does this inspire you to take even greater security protections?**
I feel better knowing that I have knowledge of my data being leaked and being able to change my password! Yes, it makes me want to change all of my passwords and be more aware about who and what I give my data to.
