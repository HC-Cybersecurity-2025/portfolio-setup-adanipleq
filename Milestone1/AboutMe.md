# Hello! My name is Ada Niple!

My career interest in cybersecurity is to become at least a Security Technician, but I hope there are many oppurtunities available to me!

My background: I graduated from Vinton County HS in 2025. My hobbies consist of playing video games and action figure model building! I don't have applicable work experience related to cybersecurity.

My goals: My goals are to get certified and possibly transfer to higher education upon completeing my time at Hocking. Career-wise I would hopefully like to climb the corporate ladder and gain experience in IT.
