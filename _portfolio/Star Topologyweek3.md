# Star Topology

*What is a star topology?*
A **Star topology** is a design of a network, where all devices are connected to a centralized hub. It is called a "star" topolgy becasue it can look like a star on paper.

*How do they work?* 
Star Topologies work by multiple devices being connected to a hub directly. All devices communicate with the hub indiviually, allowing for easy troubleshooting.

*What devices are required, what connections are used, and what do you have to configure on the end devices to get them connected?*
You'll need multiple end devices and a router or switch. They can be connected wirelessly or through ethernet ports. You'll have to configure the central switch/hub with appropriate network settings like VLANs and security, and configure each connected device with its own IP address so all devices can communicate properly.
