# Ram Types
There are two categories of RAM (random access memory): **SRAM and DRAM.** They are characterized by their ability to refresh. DRAM uses capacitors and requires periodic refreshing, whereas SRAM has transistors and doesn't need to refresh. SRAM is for cache memory (Ideal for CPU caches and registers where very high speed is essential.), DRAM is for main memory (Primarily used as the main memory in computers, smartphones, and other devices.) 
# Storage device differences
- SSD (solid state drive): use flash memory, electric, high speed, and more expensive than HDDs.
- HDD (hard disk drives): mechanical, use spinning magnetic platters and a read/write head to store and retrieve data, cheaper than SSD, slower than SSD
