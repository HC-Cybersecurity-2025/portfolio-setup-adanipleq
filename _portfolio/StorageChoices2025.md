*What storage type is best for you in 2025?* 

# HDD

Hard Drives are best for budgets and not portible PC's.

SSD's are very versatile and do not take up much space, though they are higher in price.

# SSHD

A hybrid drive integrates traditional hard drive storage with a solid-state drive, which is basically a faster version of a hard drive.
